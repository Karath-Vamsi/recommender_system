# Building a Collaborative recommender system to customize a watchlist.

This project implements a movie recommender system using collaborative filtering techniques, leveraging TensorFlow for building and training the model. It comprises two main components: data_pipeline.py and model.py. The data_pipeline.py script is responsible for downloading, extracting, and preparing the movie dataset, including loading movie ratings and movie lists from CSV files. The Model_builder class in model.py defines the collaborative filtering model, incorporating features like normalization of ratings to account for user bias and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting. The model uses TensorFlow's Adam optimizer to iteratively train and optimize its parameters, providing personalized movie recommendations based on user ratings. The system is designed for easy deployment, requiring installation of dependencies via a requirements.txt file. Overall, the project showcases an efficient and scalable approach to building a recommender system suitable for generating personalized watchlists.
